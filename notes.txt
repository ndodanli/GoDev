As an alternative, if you already have a directory like $HOME/bin in your shell path and you'd like to install your Go programs there, you can change the install target by setting the GOBIN variable using the go env command:

$ go env -w GOBIN=/path/to/your/bin
or

$ go env -w GOBIN=C:\path\to\your\bin
